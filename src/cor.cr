# Cor (which means color in Portuguese) is a library for more easily
# working with colors in Crystal. You can think of it as a more
# powerful version of `Colorize`. Cor allows you to very
# easily convert RGB(A) values to hex and back again for
# use in CSS and HTML. It also provides a set of
# chainable methods for creting colorful strings
# for the terminal using truecolor.
#
# For full usage instructions see the README.
